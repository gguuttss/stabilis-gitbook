# üêû Acknowledged bugs

Found a bug that isn't listed yet? Send it in [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh4-J6LsVaROk1C3GwkSRg2oqTvdmEGUWOUFmNd4oX2jI0Tg/viewform)!

**Acknowledged bugs:**

**General:**

* Terms and conditions point to a website that doesn't exist \[2]
  * Note from team: this is kinda intentional as it was a placeholder for when t\&c's are available, but I'll grant you this acknowledgement as it does seem a bit strange ;) (and as a reward for actually checking the t\&c's)
* Metadata for Liquidation Receipt is wrong \[2]

**Swap page:**

* APY tooltip not visible on mobile \[3]
* Interest rate, market price & internal price not visible on mobile \[1]
* APY value showing as "-" \[4]
  * Note from team: strange... seems to have to do something with API calls failing. Not sure why...

**Borrow page:**

* It is currently impossible to borrow at exactly 75% CR \[1]

**Liquidations page:**

* Disconnecting the wallet doesn't reset the liquidations widget properly \[5]
* Front-end doesn't reset after liquidating without a marker (you need to reload the page) \[1]
* Liquidation marker shows it's useable even when 5 minutes haven‚Äôt passed, and thus isn‚Äôt \[1]
