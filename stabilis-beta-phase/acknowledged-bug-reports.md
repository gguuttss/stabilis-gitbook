**Acknowledged bugs:**

**General:**

* Terms and conditions point to a website that doesn't exist \[2]
  * Note from team: this is kinda intentional as it was a placeholder for when t\&c's are available, but I'll grant you this acknowledgement as it does seem a bit strange ;) (and as a reward for actually checking the t\&c's)
* Metadata for Liquidation Receipt is wrong \[2]

**Swap page:**

*

**Borrow page:**

* It is currently impossible to borrow at exactly 75% CR \[1]

**Manage loans page:**

* Liquidation marker shows it's useable even when 5 minutes haven‚Äôt passed, and thus isn‚Äôt \[1]
