**Acknowledged suggestions\*:**

**General:**

* <mark style="color:blue;">Warn user when input will make transaction fail / don't allow them to input when transaction will fail \[1]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Add total market cap of STAB on protocol overview \[9]</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">Add protocol's total collateral and total debt to protocol overview \[9]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Specify interest rate as APY or APR \[9]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Disable buttons when actions aren't possible \[4]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Show toast notifications for submitted / completed actions \[1]</mark>
  * <mark style="color:blue;">Include link to completed transaction \[9]</mark>
* <mark style="color:orange;">Reset input fields after action \[1]</mark>
  * <mark style="color:orange;">E.g. on swap page, manage liquidity, manage loans</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Clearly display links to form in Feedback Reward Program documentation \[2]</mark>
* Clicking the max. button when using XRD for borrowing / swapping should leave some XRD for the transaction fees \[3]
  * Note: should it really? It's a good shout, but some dApps do, and some dApps don't. For instance, you can pay fees from another account.
* Create video's to explain the protocol and how to use it \[5]
  * Note: very good idea, but will have to wait a bit for the front-end to become more polished so it doesn't have to be changed any time soon.
* Integrate a service that notifies user of pending liquidation of their loans to give them the opportunity to save it \[11] / Allow user to set a warning if their collateral value reaches a certain treshold \[15]
  * Note: awesome idea, but will need some time.
* Additional language support \[13]
  * Note: good idea, but will not come soon, as it's a bit of a waste to translate things that are bound to change anyway.
* <mark style="color:blue;">Add liquidation timestamp to Liquidation Receipt NFTs. \[3]</mark>

**Swap page:**

* <mark style="color:orange;">Improve manage liquidity widget</mark>
  * <mark style="color:blue;">By adding liquidity value \[1]</mark>
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Adding volume \[12]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Display more decimals for swap output \[4]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Add TVL of STAB pool \[9]</mark>

**Borrow page:**

* <mark style="color:orange;">Refresh borrowing widget after transaction completion \[1]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Disable collateral amount input until collateral is selected to make clear a collateral needs to selected or make XRD default collateral \[1]</mark>
* <mark style="color:orange;">Add extra information in loan receipt dropdown such as collateralization ratio / status \[1]</mark>
* Add ability to type in collateralization ratio \[2]
  * Note: not sure about this, don't see it fitting in the current design, further suggestions are welcome.
* Add more collateral types \[8]
  * Note: LSUs are already useable, what other collaterals would you like to see?
* Add price at which loan can be liquidated \[14]
  * Note: is difficult, as the interest rate makes this variable.

**Manage loans page:**

* <mark style="color:orange;">Make closed / liquidated loan receipts burnable \[1]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Add preview of added/removed collateral \[1]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Add ‚ÄúIn Danger‚Äù loan status, for loans that haven‚Äôt been marked but have a CR < MCR \[1]</mark>
* Add ability to close multiple loans at a once \[2]
  * Note: is this useful / necessary? How is this going to work? The user will need to close loans which they don't even know the status of. Or some other interface needs to be built. To force the user to pay attention to all loans, it might be better to force them to go through them individually.
* <mark style="color:blue;">Easier way to add / remove collateral to a loan (e.g. max button and slider with percentage of new CR) \[2]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Disable / remove the remove collateral and close loan sections when appropriate \[5]</mark>
* Add ability to view all loans in table format for a quick overview \[7]
  * Note: good idea, bit hard to fit into the current front end. Maybe some third-party / separate tooling is better suited for this?
* <mark style="color:orange;">Make it possible to borrow more using a loan receipt / pay off part of the loan receipt \[9]</mark>

**Liquidations page:**

* <mark style="color:orange;">Add ability to automatically burn marker after liquidating \[2]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Display amount of loans that are available to mark / liquidate \[3]</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">Liquidation without marker isn't clear, show loans that are available, otherwise knowing how many to skip is impossible \[7]</mark>

**Documentation:**

* Add tiles / photo's of front-end pages in relevant docs sections. \[3]
  * Note: very good idea, but will have to wait a bit for the front-end to become more polished so it doesn't have to be changed any time soon.
* Add documentation about protocol related NFTs such as the liquidation receipts or marker receipts. \[3]
* Add glossary with abbreviations / key terms. \[3]
* Add team section \[9]
* <mark style="color:blue;">Add documentation on STAB interest rate and what its uses are \[10]</mark>

**Design:**

* Grey buttons seem like they aren‚Äôt usable. Use different color such as black button / white text \[1]
* Use different color for highlighting words \[6]
* Use lighter footer font \[6]
* Header looks dated, maybe change font weight (300, 400 perhaps) \[6]
* Consider using Lato, Helvetica or Sohne instead of Outfit as font \[6]
* Consider using a white divider \[6]
* Make header sticky on mobile for easier navigation \[1]
