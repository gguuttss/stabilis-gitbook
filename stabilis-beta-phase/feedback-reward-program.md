# ðŸ“© Feedback reward program

Provide feedback on our open beta and be rewarded ILIS (the protocol's governance token, more information coming soon) at Mainnet launch!\*

Three categories of feedback are accepted:

1. [General feedback](https://forms.gle/gbrkvVZRY615R3P49)\
   Tell us what you liked, and what you didn't. Can only be provided once per person to prevent abuse. Responses can be edited after submitting them. To ensure only one response per person we will collect and verify your email. Don't want this? Don't worry, the other two methods are anonymous!\
   \
   Do so here: [https://forms.gle/ayftNkq3wBMmGPhR7](https://forms.gle/ayftNkq3wBMmGPhR7)\

2. [Suggestions](https://forms.gle/TwNvCLDFDkxXegao8)\
   Have a suggestion, share it! To be eligible for rewards, your suggestion needs to be acknowledged first ([see acknowledged suggestions](acknowledged-suggestions.md)). It also needs to be new, so making a suggestion similar to one that has already been acknowledged won't count...\

3. [Bug/mistake reports](https://forms.gle/bDAQx6REGDo1SagWA)\
   Found a bug, report it! To be eligible for rewards, your report needs to be acknowledged first ([see acknowledged reports](acknowledged-bug-reports.md)). It also needs to be new, so reporting a bug that has already been acknowledged won't count...\

Feedback can be on anything. So think documentation, website interface or wallet display.\*\*

Have an innate hate for anything Google? Give feedback in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/stabilislabs).

**Reward distribution**

We want to heavily incentivize providing feedback, so (at least) 6% of the total ILIS supply is allocated to rewarding feedback. These tokens will be evenly distributed over all feedback categories (so, 2% per category).

Two minor details apply:

1. The maximum amount of ILIS rewarded for a single piece of feedback / report / suggestion is 0.1% of the total ILIS supply. So if only 5 bugs are reported, 0.5% instead of 2% will be going to bug report rewards. If possible, the leftover rewards will be added to the other feedback categories, but otherwise stay in possession of the DAO.
2. The maximum amount of received feedback rewards per wallet will be 1% of total ILIS supply. Rewards exceeding this will stay in possession of the DAO.

**Bug or suggestion?**

To know which form to fill in, it might be useful to know what we define as a bug, and what we define as a suggestion.

A **bug** is something that is not working the way it is intended to.

A **suggestion** you make if you would like to see something added or done differently. This doesn't require something to be "broken".

Don't sweat it too much though. If we think you chose the wrong form, we will just treat you feedback as though it was submitted using the other form.



\* The date for _Mainnet launch is not yet set in stone, and could be some way out still. So, don't expect to be receiving your tokens soon._

_\*\* The Stabilis Labs team is ultimately the one that decides whether bugs/mistakes or suggestions are acknowledged though. For example, a single spelling mistake will probably not get acknowledged. Do send them in though, as we still appreciate ALL feedback._
