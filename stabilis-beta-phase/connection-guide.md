# ðŸ“¶ Connection guide

To use the Stabilis open beta, walk through the follow steps:

1. **Configure wallet settings**\
   To enable you wallet to interact with a Stokenet app, you need to change some settings. Open the Radix wallet app and click the cogwheel on the top right. Next, click "App Settings", where you'll find the "Developer Mode" setting. Enable it, and from the same section click "Network Gateways". Add a new gateway: https://stokenet.radixdlt.com. Make sure to select it afterwards.
2. **Create a wallet**\
   Now your app is configured to Stokenet, you can create a wallet in the same way you're used to.
3. **Get some Stokenet XRD**\
   To use Stabilis, you will need some XRD. Select your newly created wallet, click the three dots in the upper left, and then click the "Get XRD Test Tokens" button. This will give you 10,000 XRD to test with. Ran out of XRD? Just repeat the same process.
4. **Go and test Stabilis!**\
   You are ready to use Stabilis. Go to the Stabilis app, and click the "Connect" button in the top right! Congratulations, you are connected, and can use the Stabilis app!\
