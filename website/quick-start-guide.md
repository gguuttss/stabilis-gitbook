# ðŸŒŸ Quick start guide

Just want to get started quickly? Here's an example of a typical user flow:

1. **Borrow**\
   The meat and potatoes of Stabilis is the borrowing of STAB. By providing collateral to the protocol, you can open an overcollateralized loan of STAB tokens. Be careful not to get liquidated though! If your collateral value drops below 150% (MCR) of your debt value, other people can pay off your debt. If this happens, you'll be fined.\
   \
   On the [Borrow page](https://beta.ilikeitstable.com/borrow), open a loan by choosing an amount of collateral to provide, and your desired collateralization ratio.
2. **Use your STAB**\
   You now own some STAB, which you can use however you'd like. [Swap it](https://beta.ilikeitstable.com/swap) for another token, use it in another protocol or [provide it as liquidity](https://beta.ilikeitstable.com/swap).
3. **Keep an eye on available liquidations**\
   Ensuring all STAB loans stay overcollateralized is done by Stabilis' own users. On the [Liquidations](https://beta.ilikeitstable.com/liquidations) page you can automatically mark loans with too low collateral value. After doing so, you receive a Marker receipt, with which you can liquidate the loan (and be rewarded for it) after a small delay of 5 minutes.
4. **Check in periodically**\
   To prevent becoming a victim of liquidation, it is of utmost importance to monitor the health of your outstanding loans! You can do so on the [Manage loans](https://beta.ilikeitstable.com/manage-loans) page, where you can add and remove collateral from your loan accordingly (or pay it off completely).

That's the gist of it! If you still have questions, chances are they will be answered by reading the [FAQ](../introduction/faq.md). If not, feel free to ask them in the [Telegram](https://t.me/stabilislabs) group.

Up next, you'll find more detailed information on the individual interface pages of Stabilis.
