# ðŸ’± Swap

**Manage liquidity**\
Removing / adding liquidity can be done using the section on the right. The pool is used to determine the price STAB is trading at, and is an integral part of the protocol! The LP token is called LPSTAB (will use the pool unit functionality at main net, but is currently not). Fees are set to 0.1%.
