# ðŸ“Š Manage loans

**Loan info**\
Selecting a Loan Receipt will show an **overview** of its status. Keep an eye on its collateralization ratio, as you don't want your loan to be liquidated.

**Manage position**\
With a Loan Receipt selected, you can add/remove collateral or fully close it. Removing collateral is only allowed if the collateralization ratio stays above 150%.

**Protocol overview**\
The state of the protocol is displayed on the right of the page, to give the user as much insight as possible.&#x20;
