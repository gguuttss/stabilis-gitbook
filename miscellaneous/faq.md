# ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How do I get STAB?**\
A: You can acquire STAB either by borrowing it through the Stabilis Protocol, or buying it on the open market.

**Q: How do I borrow STAB?**\
A: Borrowing STAB can be done through the [Borrow page](https://ilikeitstable.com/borrow) of the Stabilis dapp.

**Q: Is borrowing STAB dangerous?**\
A: There are [risks ](../introduction/dangers.md)to borrowing STAB. A big one is liquidation risk: if your collateral value falls below a certain treshold (MCR), being liquidated is a possibility. Another user then pays off your debt, in return for (part of) your collateral. When this happens, you pay the [liquidation penalties](system-parameters.md). To prevent this, keeping close tabs on your loans using the [Manage loans page](https://ilikeitstable.com/manage-loans), is important.

**Q: What is the MCR?**\
A: MCR stands for Minimum Collateralization Ratio, and represents the minimum amount of collateral is needed to not get liquidated. If a loan's collateralization ratio is below the MCR, another user can pay it of and the loan holder will be penalized.\
\
The current MCR is 150% for all collateral types, meaning the collateral value must be above 150% of the debt value.

**Q: What does the interest rate entail?**\
A: STAB tokens are subject to an interest rate. The interest rates can vary from -33.33% to +50% per year and are set by STAB supply and demand. Negative interest is attractive for STAB borrowers, as their debt decreases over time, whereas positive interest is attractive for STAB holders, as their assets increase in value. More about its calculation [here](stab-interest-rate.md).

**Q: I'm interested, but it's all a bit much. Where do I get started?**\
A: Understandable! Following the [typical user flow](../website/quick-start-guide.md) we have drafted will hopefully make things a lot more accessible.

**Q: How do I get a Stabilis Staking ID?**\
A: You can easily create one on the dapp's [Incentives page](https://ilikeitstable.com/incentives).

**Q: What is LPSTAB?**\
A: [LPSTAB ](../tokens/lpstab.md)is the LP token of the XRD/STAB pool integrated into the Stabilis protocol. Providing it with liquidity returns the LPSTAB tokens to represent your share of the pool.

**Q: What is ILIS?**\
A: [ILIS ](broken-reference)(I Like It Stable) is the native token of the Stabilis ecosystem. It will be used in governance, and to distribute protocol acquired fees. It is not currently available in this phase of the open beta.
