# Transaction manifests

The Stabilis protocol consists of multiple components:

* Stabilis Component: address here
* Flash Loan Component: address here
* Stabilis Proxy Component: address here
* Stabilis DEX Component: address here
* Oracle Component: address here

The three main interactions impossible through the front-end are using flash loans, forced liquidations and forced minting. These are all handled by the Stabilis Proxy Component.
