# ðŸ•º STAB

STAB (STAble Basis), is a stable asset, brought to life by borrowing it through the dapp's[ Borrow page](https://beta.ilikeitstable.com/borrow).

Its **unique** feature is that it is not hard-pegged to a single USD valuation; STAB tokens are subject to an interest rate. The interest rates can vary from -33.33% to +50% per year and are set by STAB supply and demand. Negative interest is attractive for STAB borrowers, as their debt decreases over time, whereas positive interest is attractive for STAB holders, as their assets increase in value.

**For an explanation of this interest rate change, see the** [**STAB interest rate.**](../technical-information/stab-interest-rate.md)
