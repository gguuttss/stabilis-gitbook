# ðŸª™ ILIS

ILIS (I Like It Stable), is the native governance token to the Stabilis ecosystem.

The Stabilis protocol accrues assets in the form of liquidation penalties and flash loan fees. These funds shouldn't stay locked away forever and we are thinking about the best way to transfer their value to ILIS holders. Currently, a burning system similar to CaviarNine's FLOOP is high on the list of possibilities, but ultimately, the exact implementation is up to the DAO.
