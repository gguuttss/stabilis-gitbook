# ðŸ¤½ LPSTAB

LPSTAB is the LP token of the XRD/STAB pool integrated into the Stabilis protocol. Providing it with liquidity returns the LPSTAB tokens to represent your share of the pool. Because they are pool units, that's also where they show up in your wallet.

The XRD/STAB pool is set to take a 0.1% fee, which goes to liquidity providers. On the swap page, you can see the APY on providing liquidity. Curious to know how it is calculated? Go [here](../miscellaneous/lp-apy-calculation.md).
