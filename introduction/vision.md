# ðŸ‘€ Vision

Traditionally, providing stability may be profitable, but provides little benefit to others. While at other times, providing stability is unprofitable, but provides much benefit others. This leads to inefficient markets and occasionally even failed stability...

What if is doesn't have to be this way? What if we could incentivize providing stability when it's unattractive, and disincentivize it when it is too attractive?

That's our vision: **fair-priced stability**
